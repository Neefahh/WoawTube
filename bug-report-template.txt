#Bug Report Template
The reason for having a template is so that you can have the best experience possible as fast as possible. If I can reproduce the exact 
steps that you took when running into the bug I can experience the same error and locate the problem faster. And as a result squish them faster.

#All you have to do is answer these 5 quick questions (only takes 30 seconds):

1. Did you experience this bug more than once, how many times?
2. What link were you using?
3. Are you sure your internet was working at the time of the bug?
4. Was it a single video or playlist?
5. Which download option did you select?
